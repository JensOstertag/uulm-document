\section{Usage}
\subsection{Getting Started}
At first, you may want to \textbf{create} a \textbf{Project Folder} on your Device, where you keep all Files regarding your Document.

Then, please \textbf{download} the \textbf{current Version} from \href{https://github.com/JensOstertag/uulm-document}{GitHub} and unpack the Files. Next, you have to \textbf{move} the \textbf{File} \textit{uulm-document.cls} and the \textbf{Directory} \textit{img} \textbf{to} your \textbf{Project Folder}.

{\setlength\parindent{24pt} \color{gray}\textit{uulm-document.cls} is the Documentclass File and the Directory \textit{img} contains all Images.

It is suggested to put all of your Images there, too.}

As the last Step you can \textbf{create} the \textit{.tex} \textbf{File} for your Document.
